# NASM-Assembly
Lab projects for COSC 2329 at SHSU. The labs were meant to be completed as if on a four bit machine, so for the most part we did not use 32 or 64 bit operations or registers (eax/rax).

Made available for reference as many of the internet resources for NASM didn't exactly pertain to the scope our labs worked within.
